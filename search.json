Member rides are consistently shorter than casual rides.\nCasual-Docked consistently has the longest median ride duration and appears to capture rides taken on a day pass. For this analysis I have assumed that Casual-Docked rides are primarily visitor traffic. As visitors are unlikely to take up membership, they can be dropped from the analysis.\nBoth member and casual groups electric bikes have a shorter ride duration than classic bikes.\nCyclistic pricing changed on 10 May 2022. The changes reduced the casual unlock fee from $3.30 to $1.00 and removed 30 minutes included time for classic bikes and e-bike trips. There is an indication that the median duration for Casual-Classic and Casual-Electric trips has declined from May 2022 onwards.\n\n\nCode\nday_rides <- bike_rides %>%\n  filter(bike_type != \"Docked\") %>%\n  mutate(weekend = if_else(\n    dayw %in% c(\"Sat\", \"Sun\"),\n    \"Weekend\",\n    \"Weekday\"\n  )) %>%\n  group_by(\n    user_bike,\n    yday = floor_date(started_at, \"day\")\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(\n    weekend,\n    duration_mins = as.numeric(median(ride_time)) / 60\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbasic %>%\n  ggplot(aes(\n    month, rides,\n    group = user_bike,\n    colour = user_bike\n  )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = scales::breaks_width(50000),\n    labels = scales::label_comma()\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    breaks = scales::breaks_width(\"2 months\"),\n    labels = scales::label_date(\"%b %Y\", tz = \"America/Chicago\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Rides per month\",\n    colour = \"Segment\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Rides per month by market segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nm <- day_rides %>%\n  group_by(\n    user_bike,\n    weekend\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_duration = mean(duration_mins)\n  )\n\nday_rides %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      duration_mins,\n      colour = weekend,\n      group = weekend,\n      alpha = 0.7\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_density(adjust = 3) +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = m,\n    aes(\n      xintercept = mean_duration,\n      colour = weekend,\n      alpha = 0.8\n    )\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(\n    rows = vars(user_bike)\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    alpha = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlim(0, 25) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Median daily ride duration\",\n    colour = \"Day Type\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of median daily ride times"
