    "text": "Background\nIn 2016 Cyclistic launched a bike-sharing sharing offering which has grown to a fleet of 6000 geotracked bicycles and network of more than 1000 stations across Chicago.\nAnalysis by Cyclistic’s finance team has determined that riders who purchase annual memberships are more profitable than casual riders.\nHead of marketing, Lily Moreno, has set a goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders to members. The intial step is to better understand how casual users and members differ. This information will provide a basis for members of the marketing analytics team to investigate why casual riders might purchase a membership, and how digital media could influence marketing strategy.\nThe executive team, which is detail oriented, will decide whether the proposed marketing strategies are approved.\n\n\nDefining the business task\nThe scope of this analysis is limited to the first step, and investigates the question:\n\nHow do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\nUnpacking this question highlights a number of areas that may provide useful insights.\n\nWhat defines a member and a casual rider?\nThe Divvy Bikes pricing information indicates members pay an upfront annual fee to access pricing that includes “no-charge” ride time and lower per minute charges. Casual riders access ride sharing on an ad-hoc basis, paying a per-ride charge, and higher per minute charge which begins when the bike is undocked. Daily pass riders pay a day access fee to access unlimited 3 hour rides for the duration of the pass.\n\n\nWhat influence do the plans have on the user behaviour?\nCan we distinguish plan types by the average duration of rides? What percentage of riders exceed the included 45 minutes ride time of membership plans? Is this same for members and casuals?\nThis may help identify if time inclusions are a factor for casual riders considering membership.\n\n\nWhen do different user cohorts ride?\nWhich days, and times are popular for the different cohorts? And are there identifiable differences or commonality in behaviours?\n\n\nDoes weather influence rider behaviour?\nAre the types and number of rides related to day-to-day variations in weather or broader seasonal patterns? Are casual users “all season” or “fair weather” riders? Casual riders who ride around the year could be a group that would find membership attractive.\n\n\nWhere do different user cohorts ride?\nRiders commuting to work are likely to use docking stations in business districts during the week. Recreational riders may prefer parks and areas along the shoreline or cafe precincts. Docking stations with high levels of usage on different days of the week should provide insight into where user hotspots are located.\n\n\n\nData sources\n\nDivvy Bikes system data and pricing\nThe base data for individual rides was extracted from Divvy Bike data files covering the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022. Additional data description and a download link is provided on the Divvy Bikes system data page.\nThe license allows inclusion of data within analyses and studies published for non-commercial. This clause covers the intended use.\nDetails of current pricing for Divvy Bikes offerings was accessed on 25 September 2022.\n\n\nNOAA Climate Data\nWeather data covering September 2021 to August 2022 ordered from NOOA National Centers for Environmental Information\nO’Hare International Airport weather station was selected as representative of the Chicago region.\n\n\nDivvy Bikes historical station status\nHistorical station status identifies which stations actively used between September 2021 and August 2022. This information is used to assist identifying Divvy operational rides in the data set.\nCity of Chicago open data listing of Divvy Stations\n\n\n\nData cleaning and preparation\n\nInitial import\n\n\n\nThe Divvy trip data files have a consistent naming format YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata.zip. This allows file names to be generated for months in the range September 2021 to August 2022.\n\n\nCode\ndivvy_files <- seq(\n  my(\"September 2021\"),\n  my(\"August 2022\"),\n  by = \"months\"\n) %>%\n  enframe(\n    value = \"timestamp\"\n  ) %>%\n  glue_data(\n    \"{year(timestamp)}\",\n    \"{stringi::stri_sprintf('%02d', month(timestamp))}\",\n    \"-divvy-tripdata.zip\"\n  )\n\n\nTo preserve a local copy of the original data, zip files are downloaded to the data/raw folder. The folder is checked each time the script is run, and files which are already present are removed from the download list.\n\n\nCode\ndivvy_downloaded <- glue(\"data/raw/{divvy_files}\")\nfiles_to_dl <- divvy_files[!file.exists(divvy_downloaded)]\n\n\nAny files which are not present in the data/rawfolder are downloaded.\n\n\nCode\nif (length(files_to_dl) > 0) {\n  purrr::walk2(\n    glue(\"https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/{files_to_dl}\"),\n    glue(\"data/raw/{files_to_dl}\"),\n    download.file\n  )\n}\n\n\nThe first 1000 rows are read from September 2021 zip file. This allows read_csv to determine the type of data in each column. The “guessed” column type specification can then inspected using the spec function.\n\n\nCode\nbike_inspect <- map_dfr(\n  divvy_downloaded[1],\n  ~ archive_read(.) %>%\n    read_csv(\n      n_max = 1000,\n      show_col_types = FALSE\n    )\n)\nspec(bike_inspect)\n\n\ncols(\n  ride_id = col_character(),\n  rideable_type = col_character(),\n  started_at = col_datetime(format = \"\"),\n  ended_at = col_datetime(format = \"\"),\n  start_station_name = col_character(),\n  start_station_id = col_character(),\n  end_station_name = col_character(),\n  end_station_id = col_character(),\n  start_lat = col_double(),\n  start_lng = col_double(),\n  end_lat = col_double(),\n  end_lng = col_double(),\n  member_casual = col_character()\n)\n\n\nThe types defined in the column specification appear to be reasonable choices based on naming of the columns.\nTo verify column naming is consistent across all files, the header row from each file is read. The resulting data frame is processed using distinct() to eliminate duplicated rows. If all headers are identical the resulting data frame will have a single row.\n\n\nCode\nbike_headers <- map_dfr(\n  divvy_downloaded,\n  ~ archive_read(.) %>%\n    read_csv(\n      n_max = 1,\n      col_names = FALSE,\n      show_col_types = FALSE\n    )\n) %>%\n  distinct()\n\nstr(bike_headers)\n\n\ntibble [1 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ X1 : chr \"ride_id\"\n $ X2 : chr \"rideable_type\"\n $ X3 : chr \"started_at\"\n $ X4 : chr \"ended_at\"\n $ X5 : chr \"start_station_name\"\n $ X6 : chr \"start_station_id\"\n $ X7 : chr \"end_station_name\"\n $ X8 : chr \"end_station_id\"\n $ X9 : chr \"start_lat\"\n $ X10: chr \"start_lng\"\n $ X11: chr \"end_lat\"\n $ X12: chr \"end_lng\"\n $ X13: chr \"member_casual\"\n\n\nAfter verifying the detected formats, and checking column naming is consistent across all files, the full dataset can be imported. Passing the full column specification to read_csv() ensure that data which does not match the expected type is flagged as a problem. Issues that arise while importing data can be examined using the problems() function.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides <- map_dfr(\n  divvy_downloaded,\n  ~ archive_read(.) %>%\n    read_csv(\n      col_types = cols(\n        ride_id = col_character(),\n        rideable_type = col_factor(levels = c(\n          \"classic_bike\",\n          \"docked_bike\",\n          \"electric_bike\"\n        )),\n        started_at = col_datetime(),\n        ended_at = col_datetime(),\n        start_station_name = col_character(),\n        start_station_id = col_character(),\n        end_station_name = col_character(),\n        end_station_id = col_character(),\n        start_lat = col_double(),\n        start_lng = col_double(),\n        end_lat = col_double(),\n        end_lng = col_double(),\n        member_casual = col_factor(levels = c(\n          \"member\",\n          \"casual\"\n        ))\n      ),\n      locale = locale(tz = \"America/Chicago\")\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\nData inspection\nWith the data loaded from file, the data structure can checked with glimpse().\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  glimpse()\n\n\nRows: 5,883,043\nColumns: 13\n$ ride_id            <chr> \"9DC7B962304CBFD8\", \"F930E2C6872D6B32\", \"6EF7213790…\n$ rideable_type      <fct> electric_bike, electric_bike, electric_bike, electr…\n$ started_at         <dttm> 2021-09-28 16:07:10, 2021-09-28 14:24:51, 2021-09-…\n$ ended_at           <dttm> 2021-09-28 16:09:54, 2021-09-28 14:40:05, 2021-09-…\n$ start_station_name <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"Clark St &…\n$ start_station_id   <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"TA13070001…\n$ end_station_name   <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ end_station_id     <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ start_lat          <dbl> 41.89000, 41.94000, 41.81000, 41.80000, 41.88000, 4…\n$ start_lng          <dbl> -87.68000, -87.64000, -87.72000, -87.72000, -87.740…\n$ end_lat            <dbl> 41.89, 41.98, 41.80, 41.81, 41.88, 41.88, 41.74, 41…\n$ end_lng            <dbl> -87.67, -87.67, -87.72, -87.72, -87.71, -87.74, -87…\n$ member_casual      <fct> casual, casual, casual, casual, casual, casual, cas…\n\n\nThe output indicates that the data set has 5883043 rows, and 13 columns.

This should be checked to determine whether this is due to error or a systematic reason.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  summarise(\n    start_lat = range(start_lat, na.rm = TRUE),\n    start_lng = range(start_lng, na.rm = TRUE),\n    end_lat = range(end_lat, na.rm = TRUE),\n    end_lng = range(end_lng, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Latitude and Longitude ranges\n\n\nstart_lat\nstart_lng\nend_lat\nend_lng\n\n\n\n\n41.64000\n-87.84000\n41.39\n-88.97\n\n\n45.63503\n-73.79648\n42.37\n-87.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum start longitude and latitude values listed in Table 3 are significantly different to the remaining values. This suggests some rides may have originated outside the Chicago metropolitan area serviced by Cyclistic.\nIt appears that some latitude and longitude values may have been rounded to two significant digits. Comparing the value to itself rounded to 2 decimal places identifies potentially truncated values. Clamping the coordinates in this way means actual locations can be anywhere within 1 square kilometre area centred on the given grid location.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  group_by(Missing = is.na(start_station_id)) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Latitude = sum(start_lat == round(start_lat, 2), na.rm = TRUE),\n    Longitude = sum(start_lng == round(start_lng, 2), na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Clipped coordinates and missing start station name\n\n\nMissing\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n78535\n78530\n\n\nTRUE\n884363\n884363\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Table 1 with Table 4 indicates the number of start stations with missing names is the same as those which have rounded coordinates.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  group_by(Missing = is.na(end_station_id)) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Latitude = sum(end_lat == round(end_lat, 2), na.rm = TRUE),\n    Longitude = sum(end_lng == round(end_lng, 2), na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Clipped coordinates and missing end station name\n\n\nMissing\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n71004\n71002\n\n\nTRUE\n940576\n940576\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Table 1 with Table 5 indicates the combined count of end stations with missing latitude and longitude and those with rounded coordinates matches the count of missing end station names.\nThis suggests that there is a systemic reason for the missing data, rather than error. It seems likely the location data has been anonymised to protect riders privacy. This needs to be verified with Cyclistics data collection team.\nThe ride duration and other information appear plausible and the lack of location data does not impact analysis of this data. Records with missing location information will be retained but filtered for any analysis which depends on accurate location.\nWhile the majority of rounded coordinates occur where station names are missing approximately 8% are for stations which are named. These need to be checked during cleaning.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  summarise(\n    start_range = range(started_at),\n    end_range = range(ended_at)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Ride start and end date ranges\n\n\nstart_range\nend_range\n\n\n\n\n2021-09-01 00:00:06\n2021-09-01 00:00:41\n\n\n2022-08-31 23:59:39\n2022-09-06 21:49:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6 indicates the dataset includes rides which finished after August 2022.\n\n\n\nIn total 6431 rides are active at midnight on 31 August 2022.

This coincides with the end of daylight savings in Chicago. At 2.00am clocks went back one hour to 1.00am.\nRide start and end timestamp values in the dataset do not include timezone information. Timestamps between 1.00am and 2.00am could refer to either Central Daylight Time or Central Standard Time meaning there is an ambiguity which is very difficult to resolve.\nThe negative duration of rides which start and end between 1.00am and 2.00am can be resolved by adding 60 minutes. However the ambiguity of the rides which have one end point in this time range remains.\nI recommend that timezone be recorded as part of the timestamp in future to avoid these issues.\nFor the present analysis I’ve chosen to correct the negative timestamps between 1.00am and 2.00am and to leave the ambiguous timestamps unaltered.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides <- bike_rides %>%\n  mutate(ride_time = if_else(\n    (ride_time < 0) & (date(started_at) == date(\"2021-11-07\")),\n    ride_time + 3600,\n    ride_time\n  ))\n\n\n\n\nOther ride duration issues\nThe Cyclistic website indicates that rides of less than 60 seconds have been removed from the dataset. There are still rides present which are less than this minimum and these should be removed.\nCyclistic help pages state that if rides exceed 24 hours the bike is treated as stolen and the user can be fined $1200.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  summarise(\"< 60 seconds\" = sum(ride_time < 60), \"> 24 hours\" = sum(ride_time > 86000))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15: Trips less than 60 seconds and more than 24 hours\n\n\n< 60 seconds\n> 24 hours\n\n\n\n\n110497\n431\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe significant number of short trips indicate these have not been removed from the data prior to upload.
