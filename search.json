This allows file names to be generated for months in the range September 2021 to August 2022.\n\n\nCode\ndivvy_files <- seq(\n  my(params$start_date),\n  my(params$end_date),\n  by = \"months\"\n) %>%\n  enframe(\n    value = \"timestamp\"\n  ) %>%\n  glue_data(\n    \"{year(timestamp)}\",\n    \"{stringi::stri_sprintf('%02d', month(timestamp))}\",\n    \"-divvy-tripdata.zip\"\n  )\n\n\nTo preserve a local copy of the original data, zip files are downloaded to the data/raw folder. The folder is checked each time the script is run, and files which are already present are removed from the download list.\nAny files which are not present in the data/rawfolder are downloaded.\n\n\nCode\nfile_list <- glue(\"{params$zip_dir}/{divvy_files}\")\nfiles_to_dl <- divvy_files[!file.exists(file_list)]\n\nif (length(files_to_dl) > 0) {\n  purrr::walk2(\n    glue(\"https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/{files_to_dl}\"),\n    glue(\"{params$zip_dir}/{files_to_dl}\"),\n    download.file\n  )\n}\n\n\nThe first 1000 rows are read from September 2021 zip file. This allows read_csv to determine the type of data in each column. The “guessed” column type specification can then inspected using the spec function.\n\n\nCode\nbike_inspect <- map_dfr(\n  file_list[1],\n  ~ archive_read(.) %>%\n    read_csv(\n      n_max = 1000,\n      show_col_types = FALSE\n    )\n)\nspec(bike_inspect)\n\n\ncols(\n  ride_id = col_character(),\n  rideable_type = col_character(),\n  started_at = col_datetime(format = \"\"),\n  ended_at = col_datetime(format = \"\"),\n  start_station_name = col_character(),\n  start_station_id = col_character(),\n  end_station_name = col_character(),\n  end_station_id = col_character(),\n  start_lat = col_double(),\n  start_lng = col_double(),\n  end_lat = col_double(),\n  end_lng = col_double(),\n  member_casual = col_character()\n)\n\n\nThe types defined in the column specification appear to be reasonable choices based on naming of the columns.\nTo verify column naming is consistent across all files, the header row from each file is read. The resulting data frame is processed using distinct() to eliminate duplicated rows. If all headers are identical the resulting data frame will have a single row.\n\n\nCode\nbike_headers <- map_dfr(\n  file_list,\n  ~ archive_read(.) %>%\n    read_csv(\n      n_max = 1,\n      col_names = FALSE,\n      show_col_types = FALSE\n    )\n) %>%\n  distinct()\n\nglimpse(bike_headers)\n\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 13\n$ X1  <chr> \"ride_id\"\n$ X2  <chr> \"rideable_type\"\n$ X3  <chr> \"started_at\"\n$ X4  <chr> \"ended_at\"\n$ X5  <chr> \"start_station_name\"\n$ X6  <chr> \"start_station_id\"\n$ X7  <chr> \"end_station_name\"\n$ X8  <chr> \"end_station_id\"\n$ X9  <chr> \"start_lat\"\n$ X10 <chr> \"start_lng\"\n$ X11 <chr> \"end_lat\"\n$ X12 <chr> \"end_lng\"\n$ X13 <chr> \"member_casual\"\n\n\nAfter verifying the detected formats, and checking column naming is consistent across all files, the full dataset can be imported. Passing the full column specification to read_csv() ensure that data which does not match the expected type is flagged as a problem. Issues that arise while importing data can be examined using the problems() function.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides <- map_dfr(\n  file_list,\n  ~ archive_read(.) %>%\n    read_csv(\n      col_types = cols(\n        ride_id = col_character(),\n        rideable_type = col_factor(levels = c(\n          \"classic_bike\",\n          \"docked_bike\",\n          \"electric_bike\"\n        )),\n        started_at = col_datetime(),\n        ended_at = col_datetime(),\n        start_station_name = col_character(),\n        start_station_id = col_character(),\n        end_station_name = col_character(),\n        end_station_id = col_character(),\n        start_lat = col_double(),\n        start_lng = col_double(),\n        end_lat = col_double(),\n        end_lng = col_double(),\n        member_casual = col_factor(levels = c(\n          \"member\",\n          \"casual\"\n        ))\n      ),\n      locale = locale(tz = \"America/Chicago\")\n    )\n)\n\n\nTo improve readability rideable_type is renamed to bike_type and the _bike suffix removed from the factor levels. member_casual is renamed to user_type and the factor levels given inital caps.

This suggests some rides may have originated outside the Chicago metropolitan area serviced by Cyclistic.\nIt appears that some latitude and longitude values may have been rounded to two significant digits. Comparing the value to itself rounded to 2 decimal places identifies potentially truncated values. Clamping the coordinates in this way means actual locations can be anywhere within 1 square kilometre area centred on the given grid location.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  group_by(Missing = is.na(start_station_id)) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Latitude = sum(start_lat == round(start_lat, 2), na.rm = TRUE),\n    Longitude = sum(start_lng == round(start_lng, 2), na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Clipped coordinates and missing start station name\n\n\nMissing\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n78535\n78530\n\n\nTRUE\n884363\n884363\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Table 1 with Table 4 indicates the number of start stations with missing names is the same as those which have rounded coordinates.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  group_by(Missing = is.na(end_station_id)) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Latitude = sum(end_lat == round(end_lat, 2), na.rm = TRUE),\n    Longitude = sum(end_lng == round(end_lng, 2), na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Clipped coordinates and missing end station name\n\n\nMissing\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\n71004\n71002\n\n\nTRUE\n940576\n940576\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Table 1 with Table 5 indicates the combined count of end stations with missing latitude and longitude and those with rounded coordinates matches the count of missing end station names.\nThis suggests that there is a systemic reason for the missing data, rather than error. It seems likely the location data has been anonymised to protect riders privacy. This needs to be verified with Cyclistics data collection team.\nThe ride duration and other information appear plausible and the lack of location data does not impact analysis of this data. Records with missing location information will be retained but filtered for any analysis which depends on accurate location.\nWhile the majority of rounded coordinates occur where station names are missing approximately 8% are for stations which are named. These need to be checked during cleaning.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides %>%\n  summarise(\n    start_range = range(started_at),\n    end_range = range(ended_at)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Ride start and end date ranges\n\n\nstart_range\nend_range\n\n\n\n\n2021-09-01 00:00:06\n2021-09-01 00:00:41\n\n\n2022-08-31 23:59:39\n2022-09-06 21:49:04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6 indicates the dataset includes rides which finished after August 2022.\n\n\n\nIn total 115 rides are active at midnight on 31 August 2022.

However the ambiguity of the rides which have one end point in this time range remains.\nI recommend that timezone be recorded as part of the timestamp in future to avoid these issues.\nFor the present analysis I’ve chosen to correct the negative timestamps between 1.00am and 2.00am and to leave the ambiguous timestamps unaltered.\n\n\nCode\nbike_rides <- bike_rides %>%\n  mutate(ride_time = if_else(\n    (ride_time < 0) & (date(started_at) == date(\"2021-11-07\")),\n    ride_time + 3600,\n    ride_time\n  ))\n\n\n\n\nOther ride duration issues\nThe Cyclistic website indicates that rides of less than 60 seconds have been removed from the dataset.

The intial step is to better understand how casual users and members differ.\nThis information will provide a basis for members of the marketing analytics team to investigate why casual riders might purchase a membership, and how digital media could influence marketing strategy.\nThe executive team, which is detail oriented, will decide whether the proposed marketing strategies are approved."

How much influence does this have on behaviour such as ride duration?\n\n\nWhen do different user cohorts ride?\nWhich days, and times are popular for the different cohorts? What identifiable differences or commonality in behaviours can be seen?\n\n\nDoes weather influence rider behaviour?\nAre the types and number of rides related to day-to-day variations in weather or broader seasonal patterns? Do members and casual riders differ in this regard?\n\n\nWhere do different user cohorts ride?\nRiders commuting to work are likely to use docking stations in business districts during the week. Recreational riders may prefer parks and areas along the shoreline or cafe precincts.\nIs there a relationship between the type of bike and where users ride?"

The changes reduced the casual unlock fee from $3.30 to $1.00 and removed 30 minutes included time for classic bikes and e-bike trips. There is an indication that the median duration for Casual-Classic and Casual-Electric trips has declined from May 2022 onwards.\n\n\nSeasonal influence\nMember and Casual riding patterns appear to be sensitive to seasonal influences.\n\n\nCode\nbasic %>%\n  filter(\n    user_bike != \"Casual-Docked\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(\n    month, rides,\n    group = user_bike,\n    colour = user_bike\n  )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = scales::breaks_width(50000),\n    labels = scales::label_comma()\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    breaks = scales::breaks_width(\"2 months\"),\n    labels = scales::label_date(\"%b %Y\", tz = \"America/Chicago\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Rides per month\",\n    colour = \"Segment\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Rides per month by market segment\n\n\n\n\nThe number of rides taken by all cohorts is lowest in January and February, which coincides with the winter season.

Members take consistently more weekday rides in all seasons. Peak days for rides on causal plans are weekends - Saturday and Sunday - with a larger of rides taken on Fridays during the summer months.\n\n\nCode\nweather <- read_csv(\n  \"data/raw/chicago_climate_data_noaa.csv\",\n  show_col_types = FALSE,\n  name_repair = janitor::make_clean_names\n) %>%\n  filter(station == \"USW00094846\")\n\nrides_temp <- day_rides %>%\n  inner_join(\n    select(\n      .data = weather,\n      date,\n      tavg,\n      tmin,\n      tmax,\n      awnd,\n      prcp\n    ),\n    by = c(\"yday\" = \"date\")\n  )\n\nrides_temp %>%\n  ggplot(aes(tmax, n, group = user_bike)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"red\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_grid(\n    rows = vars(user_bike),\n    cols = vars(weekend)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Maximum Temperature (Degrees C)\",\n    y = \"Rides\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Influence of maximum temperature on ride\n\n\n\n\nThe influence of maximum daily temperatures on number of rides across weekdays and weekends shown in Figure 5.\nCasual classic bike ride numbers remain low when the maximum temperature is 10°C or below. Casual e-bike rides start increasing when the maximum temperature reaches 0°C. Casual ride numbers appear to decline once the maximum temperature reaches 30 degrees.\nWeekday member rides remain at a consistent level right though winter with similar numbers of electric and classic rides taken. Members show a slight preference for E-bikes when the maximum temperature is below 5°C. Weekend member ride numbers are around 25% lower.\nPeak ride numbers occur on days when the maximum temperature is between 25 and 35°C. E-bike ride numbers peak at higher maximum temperatures than classic bikes.\nThis suggests that E-bikes encourage casual users to ride when maximum temperatures are in the range of 0°C to +15°C and during hot weather.\nOverall, members appear to be less influenced by temperature and seasonal variation than casuals. Member rides have a consistent base of around 2000 rides per weekday through winter. Ride numbers begin to steadily increase once the daily maximum temperature reaches 0°C.\nCasual riders who are using E-bikes in cold and hot temperatures on weekdays appear to have similar behaviours to members in that they will ride in a broad range of weather conditions. Riders in this segment who ride several times a month may be candidates for membership.\n\n\nTime of day\n\n\nCode\nbr_season %>%\n  mutate(\n    weekend = if_else(\n      dayw %in% c(\"Sat\", \"Sun\"),\n      \"Weekend\",\n      \"Weekday\"\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(\n    user_bike,\n    weekend,\n    season,\n    hour\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(\n    avg_rides = n() / n_distinct(date(started_at)),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      hour,\n      avg_rides,\n      group = user_bike,\n      colour = user_bike\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Time of day\",\n    y = \"Average ride starts per hour\",\n    colour = \"Segment\"\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(\n    rows = vars(season),\n    cols = vars(weekend)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Rides by time of day, day and season\n\n\n\n\nMember and casual rides show distinct differences between weekday ride times.\nMember ride starts show two well defined peaks aligning with morning and afternoon commutes. Casual rides steadily increase across the day peaking at around 5:30pm. All cohorts display a small peak around midday.\nWeekend riding patterns show a steady increase with ride starts levelling off around 10.00am then remaining fairly constant until late afternoon. Ride starts then taper off into the evening with a small peak around 8.30pm.\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nCode\nstation_season_time <- br_season %>%\n  mutate(\n    weekend = if_else(\n      dayw %in% c(\"Sat\", \"Sun\"),\n      \"Weekend\",\n      \"Weekday\"\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  filter(\n    !is.na(end_station_name),\n    hour == 10\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(\n    longitude_end,\n    latitude_end,\n    weekend,\n    user_bike\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(nm = n()) %>%\n  group_by(weekend, user_bike) %>%\n  slice_max(nm, n = 50)\n\n# ggmap(chi_map) +\n#   geom_point(\n#     data = station_season_time,\n#     aes(\n#       longitude_end,\n#       latitude_end,\n#       colour = user_bike),\n#     alpha = 0.4,\n#     size = .75) +\n#   facet_grid(\n#     rows = vars(weekend),\n#     cols = vars(user_bike)) +\n#   theme_minimal() +\n#   theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")"
