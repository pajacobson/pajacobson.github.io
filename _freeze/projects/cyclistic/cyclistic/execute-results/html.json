6000 geotracked bicycles and network of more than 1000 stations across Chicago.\n\nAnalysis by Cyclistic's finance team has determined that riders who purchase annual memberships are more profitable than casual riders.\n\nHead of marketing, Lily Moreno, has set a goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders to members.\nThe intial step is to better understand how casual users and members differ.\nThis information will provide a basis for members of the marketing analytics team to investigate why casual riders might purchase a membership, and how digital media could influence marketing strategy.\n\nThe executive team, which is detail oriented, will decide whether the proposed marketing strategies are approved.\n\n# Defining the business task\n\nThe scope of this analysis is limited to the first step, and investigates the question:\n\n> How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\nUnpacking this question highlights a number of areas that may provide useful insights.\n\n#### What defines a member and a casual rider?\n\nThe Divvy Bikes pricing information indicates members pay an upfront annual fee to access pricing that includes \"no-charge\" ride time and lower per minute charges.\nCasual riders access ride sharing on an ad-hoc basis, paying a per-ride charge, and higher per minute charge which begins when the bike is undocked.\nDaily pass riders pay a day access fee to access unlimited 3 hour rides for the duration of the pass.\n\n#### What influence do the plans have on the user behaviour?\n\nCan we distinguish plan types by the average duration of rides?\nWhat percentage of riders exceed the included 45 minutes ride time of membership plans?\nIs this same for members and casuals?\n\nThis may help identify if time inclusions are a factor for casual riders considering membership.\n\n#### When do different user cohorts ride?\n\nWhich days, and times are popular for the different cohorts?\nAnd are there identifiable differences or commonality in behaviours?\n\n#### Does weather influence rider behaviour?\n\nAre the types and number of rides related to day-to-day variations in weather or broader seasonal patterns?\nAre casual users \"all season\" or \"fair weather\" riders?\nCasual riders who ride around the year could be a group that would find membership attractive.\n\n#### Where do different user cohorts ride?\n\nRiders commuting to work are likely to use docking stations in business districts during the week.\nRecreational riders may prefer parks and areas along the shoreline or cafe precincts.\nDocking stations with high levels of usage on different days of the week should provide insight into where user hotspots are located.\n\n# Data sources\n\n### Divvy Bikes system data and pricing\n\nThe base data for individual rides was extracted from Divvy Bike data files covering the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022.\nAdditional data description and a download link is provided on the Divvy Bikes [system data](https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data) page.\n\nThe [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) allows inclusion of data within analyses and studies published for non-commercial.\nThis clause covers the intended use.\n\nDetails of current [pricing](https://ride.divvybikes.com/pricing) for Divvy Bikes offerings was accessed on 25 September 2022.\n\n### NOAA Climate Data\n\nWeather data covering September 2021 to August 2022 ordered from [NOOA National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USW00094846/detail)\n\nO'Hare International Airport weather station was selected as representative of the Chicago region.\n\n### Divvy Bikes historical station status\n\nHistorical station status identifies which stations actively used between September 2021 and August 2022.\nThis information is used to assist identifying Divvy operational rides in the data set.\n\n[City of Chicago open data listing of Divvy Stations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations/bbyy-e7gq)\n\n# Data
